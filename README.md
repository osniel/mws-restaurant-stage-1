#### Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview:

Mobile-ready web application that allows users review/rate restaurants in their area. Users are able to mark favorite restaurants. 

### Run the demo

1. You'll need to have Python installed in your computer.

2. The server is [here](https://github.com/osniel/mws-restaurant-stage-3). To run the server you'll need Node.js, if you don't have it installed, navigate to Node's [website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install the software.

3. Clone or download the server repo, then install it's dependencies:

```
# npm i
```
Install Sails.js globally
```
# npm i sails -g
```
Start the server
```
# node server
```
You should now have access to your API server environment at port 1337.

4. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the client app with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

5. With your client and server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around!.
